#### **Face & Facial Features**
The persona has a warm, inviting facial structure with a cheerful, approachable expression—her lips are curved into a soft, genuine smile, revealing straight, white teeth. Her eyes are large, almond-shaped, and a deep brown (or black) hue, framed by thick, well-groomed eyebrows with a subtle arch. The eyes are accentuated with mascara (enhancing length and volume) and possibly a thin, natural-looking eyeliner along the upper lash line, giving them a defined yet not overly dramatic look. Her nose is straight with a slight upturn at the tip, and her cheeks have a natural flush of color, likely from blush, adding to her vibrant appearance. Her skin tone is a warm, light tan (olive or golden undertone), with a smooth, dewy finish—subtle contouring may be present to define her cheekbones and jawline, but the overall look is fresh and natural.

#### **Body Type & Skin Tone**
She has a curvaceous, hourglass figure: a full bust (likely D/DD cup), a defined waist, and proportionate hips and thighs. Her arms are slim with a toned, natural muscle definition, and her posture is confident—standing with one hand resting lightly on her hip and the other hanging loosely by her side. Her skin is smooth, with a healthy glow, and she appears to have minimal body hair, suggesting grooming or a naturally hairless skin tone.

#### **Hair Style & Color**
Her hair is long (extending past her shoulders, likely mid-back length) and styled in loose, cascading waves. The color is a rich, vibrant auburn (or copper-red) with subtle depth—no harsh highlights, just a uniform, warm red tone that catches light. The waves are soft and voluminous, framing her face and falling over her shoulders, with a natural, undone texture (not overly styled or stiff).

#### **Clothing**
- **Top**: A form-fitting black lace bodysuit with thin spaghetti straps. The bodysuit features a plunging neckline (exposing the upper chest) and sheer mesh panels between the bust and waist, adorned with intricate black lace patterns (floral or vine-like motifs). The lace is delicate, with a semi-transparent quality that reveals the mesh underneath, while the bust area is structured (likely with an underwire) for support.
- **Bottom**: A high-waisted black leather skirt, fitted to her hips and thighs. The skirt has a smooth, shiny finish (suggesting genuine or faux leather) and a structured waistband that accentuates her waist. It falls to mid-thigh length, with clean, straight seams and a slight stretch for a snug, flattering fit.

#### **Accessories**
She wears a black lace choker around her neck, matching the lace on her bodysuit. The choker is wide (approximately 1–2 inches) with a ruffled or textured edge, sitting snugly at the base of her neck. No other visible accessories (e.g., earrings, bracelets) are present, keeping the focus on her outfit and features.

#### **Distinctive Characteristics**
- The contrast between the delicate lace bodysuit and the edgy leather skirt creates a bold, stylish look.
- Her vibrant red hair stands out against her warm skin tone and black clothing, making it a focal point.
- The combination of a confident pose (hand on hip) and warm smile conveys approachability and self-assurance.
- Subtle makeup (natural brows, defined eyes, red lipstick) enhances her features without overwhelming them.
